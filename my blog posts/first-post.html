<h2>Dev Containers are your new best friend (Work in Progress) </h2>
<h3>Expect errors while this is being updated :) </h3>
<p class="post-date">Drafted on October 17, 2025</p>
<p>Now i know some people are going to burn me at the stake just for mentioning docker but truly its the only way i develop anymore</p>
<p>Dev containers have changed my workflow completely and allow me to port things between machines at a much faster rate</p><br>
<p>Not only that, but I am able to share these workflows with other developers and get them up and running with minimal effort</p>
<br>
<p>Now I will say that the drawbacks for initial setup are a little much but once you get into a flow, it gets much easier. </p>
